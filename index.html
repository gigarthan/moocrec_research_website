            <p>
              Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become an important
              phenomenon in the e-learning space. Availability of platforms like
              edX, Coursera, Udacity, Futurelearn have made accessing quality
              content effortless. But in the same time availability of multiple
              platforms with similar courses poses a challenge for the users to
              select the right courses for themselves. MoocRec Humanity tries to
              solve this issue by filtering out the right courses in different
              platforms based on the user’s learning style. MoocRec considers
              course videos’ production styles and course practical workloads
              like quizzes and reading materials to categorize courses with
              learning styles. Additionally, users can do an advanced querying
              to search through different MOOCS and filter courses based on the
              lecturer's accents. styles.

            <p>
              MOOCs have most popular and attractive platform in the field of
              e-learning and to its unique characteristics may have caused to
              make it as an effective TEL model in the current era of education
              and technology. Several researches have been carried out taking
              state-of-art of MOOCs taking into consideration. Until
              2017, over 81 million students have been registered all across the
              world and 23 million new learners have been signed up only in 2017
             . In the meantime, 9400 MOOCs have been released to the
              e-learning platform from over 800 universities in 2017 . This
              exponential growth rate is a symbolic remark which illustrates
              that the MOOCs are a new revolutionary trend that is going to be
              assisted learners all over the world providing quality education
              in a convenient way. Learning Style is the way the information is
              received and processed by the learner . Due to that cause the
              learner style is varied from learner to learner . Designing
              courses taking the learner style into consideration has been shown
              progressive efficiency. That has been proved by providing learning
              materials and activities to the learner considering their
              preferences. Moreover, the evidence to support the
              statement is provide by researches which shows students can earn
              the best learning outcomes and higher scores, and the less
              time taken to master the course. In the following literature
              survey done for individual parts are depicted,
            </p>

              In the recent years, several researches have been carried out to
              discover the learner styles of technology-driven learning. With
              the rapid growth of learner’s enrollment into e-learning,
              personalization of MOOC materials has become an interesting topic
              among researchers. Comparing with technological subjects, the
              learning styles of humanity related subjects seem to be varied.
              The capability of providing learning materials according to the
              preferences of learners would be a great achievement of addressed
              research problem. In this research, the subjects of psychology,
              music and history which are falling under the subject area of
              humanities are being considered for suggesting personalized
              learning materials. The VARK Model is adopted to concern the ways
              that students prefer to receive and process information.
              Moreover, the model has been widely used and studied to conclude
              that male and female students have different learning styles. In
              the conclusion have found out that majority of male students
              are multimodal, and the majority of female students are
              single-mode. Similarly is carried out with FSLSM model
              with the focus of computer programming courses under engineering
              education. Similar research was carried out to provide an
              in-depth analysis of FSLSM based on data from the ILS
              questionnaire in order to get more information for a better
              application of learning styles in technology enhanced environment
              .Therefore, they associated each dimension of FSLSM with semantic
              groups (such as the preference for spoken language or the
              preference for concrete learning material), and analyzed the
              impact of each group for each learning style. A hybrid approach
              was used for detecting interesting features both from research and
              from application viewpoint. Algorithmic personalization is
              presented in which involving two steps: first modeling the
              learning objects by matching each dimension of FSLSM with IEEE LOM
              meta-data elements and finally, recommending appropriate learning
              objects to the learners. Four weight values are calculated for
              each learning object. Similarly, study quotes a system that
              uses Utility-Based Recommendation technique to recommend LOs based
              on three aspects such as subject, personal preference and Learning
              Style. To validate the system, an experiment was conducted as well
              to show the degree of satisfaction of students with the
              recommended learning materials. In last year carried out to
              personalize MOOCs according to the learner style with the
              language.

              Videos are one of the most important visual mediums which has seen
              a tremendous growth in volume in the past decade. Growth of giants
              like YouTube, Hulu, Netflix etc. have made video a popular medium.
              Abundance of videos in the internet has encouraged in growth of
              various algorithms which tries to analyze the context and styles
              of the videos. Recent developments in the field of Machine
              Learning has enabled researchers and scientists to do large scale
              computations. Especially breakthroughs in deep learning and
              introduction of Convolutional Neural Network has given the
              possibility of identifying images and videos with high accuracy in
              a limited amount of time. Video classification approaches can be
              divided into four main groups: text-based approaches, audio-based
              approaches, visual-based approaches, and those that used some
              combination of text, audio and visual features . The standard
              approach to video classification involves three major stages:
              First, local visual features that describe a region of the video
              are extracted either densely or at a sparse set of interest
              points. Next, the features get combined into a fixed-sized level
              of video description. One of the popular approaches is to quantize
              all features using a learned k-means dictionary and accumulate the
              visual words over the duration of the video into histograms of
              varying spatio - temporal positions and extents. Lastly, a
              classifier (such as SVM) is trained on the resulting bag of words
              representation to distinguish among the visual classes of interest
              . Furthermore, combination of Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM
              technique is experimented which can deal with complexity,
              ambiguity, uncertainty and easily target the situations where
              complex service behavior can be deviated from user’s expectation
              . An automatic MOOC video classification is presented in.
              The proposed system does automatic topic classification of MOOC
              videos using speech transcripts and convolutional neural networks
              (CNN). This system used Khan Academy on a Stick dataset which
              contains 2, 545 videos for the experimentation. The proposed
              system relies on text features rather than using frame visual
              features. MOOC video classification based on learner style and
              presentation style has been experimented in. The proposed
              system uses a convolutional neural network to do the
              classification and can predict talking head, presentation slides
              and code. This system was tested for technology subjects and does
              not consider about humanities. Humanities consist of different
              combination of presentation styles and we are going to extend this
              system for humanities with a motive of identifying different set
              of presentation styles.

              Recognize the abstract topic in the MOOCs modules transcripts,
              pdfs, text tutorials, module descriptions could be support us to
              refine the modules in the courses. Topic modelling is a text
              mining approach which automatically apportion the entire
              document/s into a number of “topics” organize as a cluster,
              encapsulate and recognize huge document set in concise of time
              . Another technique to identify the topic by using keyword/s is
              the clustering technique. This is used for multiple type documents
              topic identification. The topic is actually the cluster of
              keywords where keywords are extracted by some weighting scheme
              using the formula.
              There are two technique of “TOPIC DETECTION MODEL BASED ON
              KEYWORD” that is “weight calculating method based on keyword” and
              “topic detection model algorithm”. Similarly, the research 
              says that an automated phrase mining framework with two innovative
              methods, the “robust positive only distant training” and the “POS
              guided phrasal segmentation incorporating part of speech (POS)
              tags” Sarah E. Petersen, Mari Ostendorf. “A machine learning
              approach to reading level assessment”. In this paper, they combine
              features from n-gram LMs (Language Model), an automatic parser,
              and traditional methods of readability assessment in an SVM
              (Support Vector Machine) framework to classify texts based on
              reading level. They show that unlabeled negative training data can
              be used to augment a corpus with only positive labels, but more
              effectively for a detection paradigm than regression. It also
              confirms other findings that syntactic features have only a small
              effect on the overall performance of the detectors. Both
              regression and detection SVMs compare favorably to other existing
              methods using several different methods to measure performance.
              The SVM performance is better than that of human annotators when
              both are compared to the Weekly Reader labels, but the humans
              appear to be using different annotation criteria since their
              inter-annotator agreement is higher than their agreement with the
              Weekly Reader labels. Sarah E. Schwarm, Mari Ostendorf. “Reading
              Level Assessment Using Support Vector Machines and Statistical
              Language Models”. Statistical LMs (Language Model) were used to
              classify texts based on reading level, with trigram models being
              noticeably more accurate than bigrams and unigrams. Combining
              information from statistical LMs with other features using support
              vector machines provided the best results. Finding topical texts
              at an appropriate reading level is a challenge for the learners.
              This task can be addressed with natural language processing
              technology to assess reading level. In this paper, they also use
              support vector machines to combine features from traditional
              reading level measures, statistical language models, and other
              language processing tools to produce a better method of assessing
              reading level. Samer Hassan and Rada Mihalcea. ”Learning to
              Identify Educational Materials”. This paper contains how to
              automatically identify educational materials, by classifying
              materials with respect to their educative value. Through
              experiments carried out on a data set of manually annotated
              documents, they show that the generally accepted notion of a
              learning object “educativeness” is indeed a property that can be
              reliably assigned through automatic classification. Here they
              formulated the task as a text categorization problem and try to
              automatically classify the “effectiveness” of a document (defined
              as a property that reflects the educative value of a document).
              The educativeness property is assign by manually. Here the
              experiment is carried out for the computer science domain.

              personalization in e-learning process based on triple-factor
              architecture”. In this study, it shown that there is an impact of
              triple-factor (relationship among learning style, motivation and
              knowledge ability) on learning activities. This study proposes a
              dynamic personalization in e-learning process based on
              triple-factor architecture. The triple-factor support
              identification and personalization of learning material and
              recommendation in e-learning process. The architecture consists of
              five main layers: learning strategy layer, learning layer,
              activity layer, identification layer and personalization layer.
              Here the researches used FSLSM learning style. According to this
              learning style the learning materials were classified. For each
              learning style they found a learning material. And, the relevant
              materials used to provide the student based on their learning

              Currently, the passion towards learning new subject areas among
              the community is noticeably increased. Due to technological
              advancement e-learning has provided proper assistance for the
              above-mentioned community who are keen on learning new subject
              areas. Under the e-learning MOOCs are the most popular relatively
              reason learning tendency with various platforms available like
              Coursera, Edx , Udacity, Futurelearn etc. The openness of the MOOC
              platforms is one of the major reasons of its popularity among huge
              audience coming from different backgrounds all over the world.
              With the popularity of this particular concept, more and new MOOC
              providers step in to the field where the different displaying
              methods of information are available. This brings much
              inconvenience to the users when choosing the best option. As
              recent researches reveal, the statistics of the learners who drop
              the e-learning courses before completion become highly increasing.
              The major reasons for dropping courses as revealed are the
              discrepancy among the personal requirement and the course content
              such as presentation styles, teaching styles and time etc. Under
              such a situation, the importance of one unified platform where the
              learners can choose courses based on their preferences is highly
              demandable. The personalization of learning styles is a big
              talking point over the recent years to provide learning materials
              according to the preferences of learners. In the meantime, it
              would be much more supportive, considering the accent and gender
              of the tutor. AS researches revealed, the language is one of the
              key major factors to master new subject. As several studies
              quoted, the leaning or mastering new subject become more
              effortless when the resources are provided appropriately.
              Currently available MOOCs search engines do not provide the
              facility to search courses depending on the learning styles
              associated with gender and the accent of the tutor. Taking the
              above-mentioned facts into consideration, the existing huge demand
              of a unified platform for recommending MOOCs depending on learner
              style of the user and the search engine which allows the users to
              filter more advanced multiple fields can be concluded.
